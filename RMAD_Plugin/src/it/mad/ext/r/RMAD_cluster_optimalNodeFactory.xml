    <shortDescription>
        Cluster Optimal will search for the optimal k-clustering of the dataset.

        <intro>
        The hypothesis test is formulated as a model selection problem, where the aim is to identify the model with the highest posterior probability. A Hierarchical Bayes model is assumed for the data. Note that firstly, the null hypothesis is equivalent to saying that the population consists of just one cluster. Secondly, since the functions here only allow the alternative hypothesis to be either 2, 3 or 4 at any one time, the package allows the user to test multiple hypotheses while controlling the False Discovery Rate (FDR).
        Cluster Optimal will search for the optimal k-clustering of the dataset.
		<br/> Completion may take several minutes depending on the dimensions of the dataset and how high is the number assigned to the parameter "nsim".

        <tab name="Standard Options">
        	<option name="Filter">Filtering of data matrix or data frame. Each row must correspond to an observation, and each column must correspond to a variable. All variables must be numeric. Missing values (NAs) are allowed.</option>
        	<option name="Clusters">The number of clusters. It is required that 0 &lt; clusters &lt; n where n is the number of observations</option>
        </tab>
        
        <tab name="Advanced Options">
        	<option name="nsim">The algorithm is based on a stochastic search through the partition space, and nsim corresponds to the number of points in the partition space to inspect. It is recommended that nsim be at least 500,000. </option>
        	<option name="aR">The Metropolis search algorithm samples points from the space of partitions according to a mixture of g and a random walk. aR, which must be a value between 0 and 1, specifies the percentage of time that the random walk is chosen. </option>
        	<option name="a">a is a hyperparameter for the prior on σ^2 . </option>
        	<option name="b">Like a, b is also a hyperparameter for the prior on σ^2 . </option>
        	<option name="tau2">tau2 is a hyperparameter for the prior on the mean μ for each cluster.</option>
        	<option name="mcs">mcs stands for Minimum Cluster Size. It should be a value between 0 and 1. It instructs the algorithm to only consider clusters of a certain minimum size.</option>
        	<option name="Keep">This argument instructs the algorithm to store the top keep number of clusters that it finds during it’s run. By default, the best 4 clusters that are found will be kept.</option>
